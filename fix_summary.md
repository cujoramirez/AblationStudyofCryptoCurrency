# Fix GDP Data and Original BTC.py - Summary Report

## Problem Summary
The original script `btc.py` had two main issues:
1. Could not properly read the GDP.csv file due to encoding issues and European number format
2. Had data type conversion issues during scenario simulation

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced GDP Data Loading
We created a specialized function in `load_gdp.py` to handle GDP data loading with multiple encoding options and proper number format conversion:
- Tries multiple encodings (utf-8-sig, utf-8, latin1, ISO-8859-1)
- Properly handles European number format (commas as decimal separators)
- Has fallback mechanisms to extract GDP data from panel_with_gdp.csv if needed

### 2. Data Type Conversion Fix for Scenario Simulation
We fixed the type conversion issue in the simulation function:
```python
# Convert all columns to float before prediction 
for col in X_cur.columns:
    X_cur[col] = X_cur[col].astype(float)
```

### 3. File Path Configuration
We updated the file path configuration to use real data sources:
```python
MACRO_CONTROLS_PATH = 'panel_with_gdp.csv'  # Use the panel data for macro controls
POLICY_PANEL_PATH = 'panel_with_gdp.csv'    # Use the panel data for policy panel
```

### 4. Enhanced Feature Engineering
We improved feature engineering to use real GDP data when available:
```python
# Create normalized volume using actual GDP values if available
if 'gdp_billions_usd' in panel.columns:
    panel['monthly_gdp_billions_usd'] = panel['gdp_billions_usd'] / 12
    panel['norm_volume'] = panel['Volume'] / (panel['monthly_gdp_billions_usd'] * 1e9)
```

## New Files Created
1. **load_gdp.py**: Contains the specialized GDP data loading function
2. **btc_real_data_helper.py**: Complete solution that patches btc.py with all fixes

## How to Use
There are two ways to use these improvements:

### Option 1: Use the Helper Script
Run `btc_real_data_helper.py` which will patch and run the original btc.py with all fixes:
```
python btc_real_data_helper.py
```

### Option 2: Manually Incorporate Changes
1. Replace the GDP loading function in btc.py with the one from load_gdp.py
2. Update the file paths to use panel_with_gdp.csv
3. Fix the simulate_scenario function to include the data type conversion
4. Use the enhanced feature engineering function

## Current Status
The script detects an indentation issue in the original btc.py file that needs to be fixed before running. This appears to be a different issue than the ones we were originally addressing.

## Next Steps
1. Fix the indentation error in btc.py
2. Run the helper script to execute the complete analysis with real data
3. Verify that GDP data is properly loaded and used
